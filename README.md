Data Scientist
---------------------------

After wrapping up a Bachelor of Science with a Major in Data Science in 2020, I started working as a Data Scientist at GrainCorp as part of the Operations Excellence team. In my free time I've been expermenting with Pytorch ML frameworks in a custom Greyhound racing model as an end to end side project to test my skills. I also have been known to try my hand at a variety of different kaggle challenges from time to time. For more info please checkout my personal website with some blog posts of what I'm working on at nbdata.co
